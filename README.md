# Minishell

## Overview

**Minishell** is a lightweight shell that mimics various features of Bash, including handling piped commands, redirections, heredoc, expansion of environment variables, signal handling, and several built-in commands. The built-in commands supported are:

- `echo`
- `pwd`
- `unset`
- `export`
- `cd`
- `env`
- `exit`

When executed, Minishell creates an interactive shell environment where you can run most standard shell commands, including the ability to run subshells within the shell itself.

## Installation

To install Minishell, use Docker to build the environment:

```docker build . -t minishell```

The build process will download the necessary dependencies and set up the Docker container. This may take a few minutes, depending on your internet speed.

## Running Minishell
Power up your minishell Docker container with this command:

```docker run -it minishell```

After the installation is complete, you can run the program using:

```./minishell```
## Exiting the Shell
To exit MiniShell, you can either:

Type the ```exit``` command or press Ctrl+D.
Please note that the usual Ctrl+C command for terminating a process wonâ€™t work as expected within Minishell. This is because signal handling is managed similarly to how Bash handles it.

## Additional Notes
Subshells: Minishell supports running subshells, allowing you to execute commands in nested shell environments.
Signal Handling: Special care has been taken to intercept and manage signals like Ctrl+C, ensuring that they behave similarly to a standard Bash shell.
